title: Cross-Chain Laundering via Bridge Hopping
id: a7f8c9d2-1e4b-4a5c-9f3d-8b6e2c5a1d9f
status: experimental
description: Detects suspicious cross-chain bridge usage patterns indicative of laundering via chain-hopping. Monitors for rapid sequences of bridge operations across multiple blockchains, fresh address creation, stablecoin pivoting, and deposits to high-risk off-ramps.
